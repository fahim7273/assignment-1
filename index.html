                Dr. Mohammad Yunus, an internationally renowned economist and social entrepreneur, served as the Chief Adviser of the People's Republic of Bangladesh during a transitional government period in 2007. However, his primary recognition comes from founding Grameen Bank, pioneering the concept of microfinance and microcredit, which has uplifted millions of impoverished people worldwide.

Dr. Yunus received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 jointly with Grameen Bank for their efforts to create economic and social development from below. His innovative approach to providing small loans without collateral transformed lives by enabling poor individuals, especially women, to start small businesses and achieve financial independence.

If you'd like specific information about his tenure as Chief Adviser or his contributions.
